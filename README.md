# The Iron Yard Durham - Python - February, 2017 Cohort

Welcome to the Python class at The Iron Yard in Durham! We are going to have an amazing semester. You're going to need to do a few things to get ready before we start class:

* [Get and setup your Mac](prework/mac.md)
* [Read through the syllabus](prework/syllabus.md)
* [Complete your prework](prework/prework.md)

The prework will take you quite some time -- probably around 40 hours -- so don't wait until the last minute to start it. It is due one week before class begins.
